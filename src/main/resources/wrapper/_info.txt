Okay, let me explain the use of this.
WorkspaceTool needs to run on a newer version of Gradle than Forge's MDK ships by default.
Most of FG works on this Gradle version, at least the stuff we care about.
So, due to how the Gradle wrapper work we can invoke this wrapper and trigger a build
of what ever project we want, with out init script and updated gradle.
